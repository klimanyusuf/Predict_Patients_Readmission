# Objective: Predict the Risk of Patients Readmission
Predict the risk of hospital readmission for patients who have been discharged from the hospital within the previous 30 days given the information in the attached dataset (taken from US Medicare patients).

# Algorithms:
K-NN Neigbors,Logistic Regression,Gradient Boosting Classifier,RandomForest, Decision Tree

# Result
Grdaient boosting has the best performance with auc accuracy  75%  which out performs other models.
We got an accuracy of 76% readmission within 30 days
